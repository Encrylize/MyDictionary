MyDictionary
============

This is a personal dictionary app written with Flask. I created it to assist me in learning German and to keep track of some words that I'd like to have written down somewhere.

Since it was written with German in mind, that's the language it'll work best for, although you could probably make it work for a few others aswell.

This is the first project I've ever finished with Flask, so it's not quite anything fancy. I may polish it a bit as I go on and learn new things.
